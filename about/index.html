                    Unanimous Decisions is a newly formed nonprofit organized to assist youth
                    in using critical thinking skills to get the best result out of any situation and
                    enable them to become better students, make career choices, say no to
                    violence, manage anger, resolve conflict, respond to bullying without force,
                    say no to drugs and gangs and manage relationships. The organization
                    promotes the use of physical training, mentoring and cognitive-behavioral
                    groups to support youth in their development. Unanimous Decisions has an
                    engaged Board of Directors that is led by Larry Bailey, the executive
                    director. Mr. Bailey has more than 30 years of experience training
                    professional boxers and more than seven years of experience mentoring
                    youth Golden Diversity. Some of his trainees have been Robert “Boo Boo”

                    Heavy Weight Champ). Sugar Ray Leonard (five time Champ) with the
                    Marvin Haggler Fight. Darrel “too sweet“ Coley to name a few. He has
                    helped numerous of youth by translating the rule of boxing to rules
                    governing behavior at home, school and in the community.

                    We will focus strongly on leadership and emotional intelligence. As the two
                    go hand in hand, we plan to mirror “The Leadership Challenge” by Kouzes
                    &amp; Posner. We use this to demonstrate the strong qualities of leadership,
                    which include the five practices of exemplary leadership. Being able to
                    control yourself and manage your relationship with others is extremely
                    important in professional life, which is defined by emotional intelligence.
                    We will be teaching and providing the tools necessary to guide the
                    individual in right path of self-awareness, social awareness, relationship
                    management, and motivation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The value that the program brings is to help bolster the youth with positive
                    activities. Such activities will gear them towards:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Youth Feel Physically and Emotionally Safe</li>
                        <li>Youth Experience Belonging and Ownership</li>
